						<h3> April 2017 - ACManoa Outreach Workshops </h3>
						<span class="image left"><img src="/img/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span>
						<p> My team and I mentored high school students from Sacred Hearts Academy and Punahou High School. This workshop focused primarily on introducing the students to web development tools such as Git, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. </p>

						<h3> October 2016 - AAUW Scholarship for the Grace Hopper Conference</h3>
						<span class="image right"><img src="/img/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>
						<p> I attended the world's largest gathering of women technologists on scholarship from AAUW Honolulu. One of the many inspirational speakers was the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of the United States of America, Megan Smith. </p>

						<h3> April 2016 - <a href="http://blog.sacredhearts.org/2016/04/coding-marathon-with-uh-association-for.html" target="_blank">ACManoa Outreach Workshops</a> </h3>
						<p> My team and I mentored high school students from Sacred Hearts Academy who were interested in programming. The students were introduced to Git, Java, and the command line. It was an opportunity to give back to the community and foster interest in the ICS program at the University.</p>

						<h3> May 2015 - <a href="https://devpost.com/software/bikeshare-implementation" target="_blank">Reboot the Commute Hackathon</a> </h3>
						<span class="image left"><img src="/img/pic05.jpg" alt="" /></span>
						<p> My team and I implemented a Bike Share Hawaii webpage where both businesses and users are able to log in and help balance the flow of traffic. Tangible incentives including reduced meals, tickets, drinks, and healthy activity are used to encourage the use of bikes that will counteract the usual flow of traffic. The Hackathon winners were invited to discuss our projects on Hawaii Public Radio's Bytemarks Cafe. <a href="http://www.bytemarkscafe.org/2015/05/">Listen here</a>.</p>

						<h3> <a href="https://github.com/blake417/DDL-Processing-Parallel-DBMS" target="_blank">DDL-Processing-Parallel-DBMS</a></h3>
						<p>
							Written in Python3 and MySQL, Blake Larson and I implemented a DDL processing component of a parallel
							SQL processing system. DDLs submitted to the system are translated into corresponding DDLs for each
							individual DBMS instance in the cluster and executed. With every MySQL statement executed, a catalog
							database is updated to store metadata about what data is stored for each table.
						</p>
						<h3> <a href="https://github.com/evpirnia/Pairwise-Distances-Calc" target="_blank">Pairwise-Distances-Calc</a></h3>
						<p>
							Written in Java, the program takes in a filename of a file with contents in the Clustal Omega alignment
							format, then determines the distance for all pairwise alignment induced by the multiple sequence
							alignment. The distance between two sequences are computed as the sum of all their
							mismatching columns (match = 0, mismatch = 1, gap = 1).
						</p>
						<h3><a href="https://github.com/evpirnia/HMM-with-State-3" target="_blank">HMM-with-State-3</a></h3>
						<p>
							Written in Java, the program is an implementation of the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) from
							S. R. Eddy (2004) with an added state "state 3" that should follow state I. The program lists all paths
						  with non-zero probabilities that could have generated the sequence 'CTTCATGTGAAAGCAGACGTAAGTCA',
							each path's corresponding probability(log), and the best path from those listed.
						</p>
						<h3><a href="https://github.com/evpirnia/Detect-Mutation" target="_blank">Detect-Mutation</a></h3>
						<p>
							Written in Java, the program is meant to take two DNA sequences of the same
							length and determine the number of mutations between the two sequences.
						</p>
						<h3><a href="https://github.com/evpirnia/evpirnia.github.io" target="_blank">My Website</a></h3>
						<p>
							Written in HTML5 and CSS3, this is my respository on GitHub for everything
							that I have done for this website.
